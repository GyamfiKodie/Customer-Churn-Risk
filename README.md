## Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a complete project on customer churn prediction, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. The project utilizes Logistic Regression and XGBoost models and adheres to industry best practices.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical business issue in many industries. Predicting churn can help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers, thus increasing profitability. This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features such as tenure, monthly charges, and total charges.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis of features and their relationship with churn, visualized through various plots.
- **Model Development**: Building and optimizing Logistic Regression and XGBoost models using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- **Model Deployment**: A basic Flask API for serving the Logistic Regression model, allowing for easy integration into applications.
- **Visualizations**: Saved plots showing feature importance, correlations, and other key insights.
